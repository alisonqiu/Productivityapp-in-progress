This is a productivity app with 
- A homepage that renders motivational quotes from an API, as well as navigation options to a pomodoro timer and a todo-list.
- A pomodoro timer with visual and sound effects
- A todo-list that stores action items in a serverless API that users can interact with in real time and stores data across sessions.

Technology used: JavaScript, CSS, Next.js, HTML, React.js, CloudFlare.

It's a work in progress. I'm currently working on the pomodoro timer
